This is a Verilog implementation of the simple "Hack" CPU described in Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken's book, The Elements of Computing Systems.

The file computer.v contains the high-level architecture of the system, and computer_tb.v is a test-bench for running simulations of the system.

The script  has been created to make it easy to compile and run test-benches using Icarus Verilog for Linux.  To run the test-bench of the overall system, simply type:
    $ ./builder.sh computer
